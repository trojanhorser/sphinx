Software Development Standards And Conventions
===========================================

Java Script Coding Conventions
------------------------------
This is a set of coding conventions and rules for use in JavaScript programming.
The long-term value of software to an organization is in direct proportion to the quality of the codebase. Over its lifetime, a program will be handled by many pairs of hands and eyes. If a program is able to clearly communicate its structure and characteristics, it is less likely that it will break when modified in the never-too-distant future. Code conventions can help in reducing the brittleness of programs.
All of our JavaScript code is sent directly to the public. It should always be of publication quality. Neatness counts.


PHP Coding Conventions 
----------------------
This guide extends and expands on PSR-1, the basic coding standard.
The intent of this guide is to reduce cognitive friction when scanning 
code from different authors. It does so by enumerating a
shared set of rules and expectations about how to format PHP code.
